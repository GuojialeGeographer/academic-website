    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

我是意大利米兰理工大学地理信息工程专业的硕士研究生（2024Fall～）。该专业隶属于米兰理工大学工程学院计算机系和土木系的联合硕士项目。
I am a master's student in Geomatics Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, Italy (Fall 2024~). This major is a joint master's program between the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Civil Engineering of the School of Engineering of Politecnico di Milano.Moving beyond traditional geography, I am now driven to become a spatial data scientist, utilizing state-of-the-art theory and technology like GeoAI, GIScience, and Spatial-temporal Data Mining to address pressing environmental and societal challenges. These experiences have not only clarified my own research interests and direction but have also equipped me with the ability to rapidly learn new knowledge and skills, allowing me to swiftly adapt to different learning and living environments. In the field of GIS project design and implementation, I have accumulated hands-on experience and can proficiently use a variety of GIS tools and techniques. Through various types of work, I have enhanced my communication, coordination, and leadership abilities, and have gained substantial experience in academic research and paper publication. These invaluable experiences have given me the confidence and ambition to successfully complete my studies and pursue a PhD after completing a master’s degree.
